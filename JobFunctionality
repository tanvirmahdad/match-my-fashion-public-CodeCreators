Two related database fields for the job aspect
[:job_name] is the string form of the class for that users profession.
    Use [:job_name].to_s.constantize to use it. For example [:job_name].to_s.constantize.view_Attr()
    
[:job_attr] is a hash, where each of the values from [:job_name].to_s.constantize.view_attr is a key, and the 
    user's input for the job's attributes is a value. Value can be of any data type.
    ## BEING CHANGED to the key is of the form :0, :1, :2, etc, and will work like an array.


All of the new GeneralInfo class methods.

GeneralInfo.see_Jobs
    Outputs an array with the name of every job class currently available.
    
GeneralInfo.see_Types
    Outputs an array of the valid types an attribute can have. Viewable in the 
    model as @@AcceptableAttrTypes
    
GeneralInfo.check_Job?(jobName)
    Checks if jobName is an existing job.
    
GeneralInfo.delete_Job(jobName)
    Removes a job from the list of available jobs. Does NOT currently rewrite 
    existing database entries with that job.

GeneralInfo.delete_Job_From_File(job_Name)
GeneralInfo.load_Job_File()
    The jobs and their attributes are saved to a file in order to reload them 
    between server restarts. These functions just write/delete jobs from that
    file and and recreates the classes based on what's saved there.
    
GeneralInfo.create_Job (jobName, writeToFile = true)
    Creates a class from string className that has the methods listed below. If writeToFile 
    is false, it will not write this class to the file mentioned above (In order to prevent 
    the file from rewriting the its contents to itself whenever it's loaded).

    jobName.edit_Attr(attr_Name, new_Name, new_Type = nil)
        Changes the name of an attribute named attr_Name to new_Name. If new_Type is left set

    jobName.view_Attr_Type(attr_Name)
        Outputs the type of an attribute attr_Name in string form. Returns nil if it doesn't exist.

    jobName.view_Attr_Type()
