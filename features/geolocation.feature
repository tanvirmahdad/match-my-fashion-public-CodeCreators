# Search Geolocation Feature

Feature: Search by location
  
  As a recruiter
  I would like to find talent nearby me or nearby another location
  So that I can find people that I could reasonably hire

  Scenario: Search by distance from where I am right now
    Given I am a valid user
    And I am on the home page
    When I follow "Search"
    Then I should be on the search page
    When I select "United States" from "country"
    And I select "TX" from "state"
    And I fill in "city" with "College Station"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "Search Results"
    And I should see "College Station, Texas"
    And I should see "Ive Yi"
