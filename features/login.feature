Feature: Login to Application

  As a fashion industry professional
  So I can login to application
  I want to enter a correct email address and password combination
  
Scenario: When correct login information is entered a user logs in successfully

  Given I am a valid user
  When I log in
  Then I should see "Logged In!"
  And I should be on the home page
  
Scenario: When incorrect password is entered, a user cannot log in

  Given I am not logged in
  And I am on the home page
  When I follow "Login"
  And I fill in "email" with "hellofriend@gmail.com"
  And I fill in "password" with "notmypassword"
  And I press "Login"
  Then I should see "Incorrect Password"
  
Scenario: When incorrect email is entered, a user cannot log in

  Given I am not logged in
  And I am on the home page
  When I follow "Login"
  And I fill in "email" with "test"
  And I press "Login"
  Then I should see "Incorrect Email"
